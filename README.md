## Technology Stack

## Project Introduction

The programming challenge for STIT frontend.

Project url: <https://yelpevent-yanggao.herokuapp.com/>.

This project is developed with react for the frontend. A proxy server supporting graphql is also set up with express in consideration of dealing with Cross-Origin issues and enhancing web performance. 

The website is consisted of two views: one for a list of events happening today and the other for a specific event's detail. What deserves to be mentioned is that the number of events (the default is 10) in the event list page can be modified by inputing the number and clicking the button beside the input.

## Getting started

* Enter into the project folder and install packages:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

* Build the client's code and start the server:

  ```
  npm start
  ```
